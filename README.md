# Video App
This is the repository for the video application that runs with node.js. Please make sure to follow the instructions to use it.

## Get the file
to get the file you have to first enter a folder in your computer, open Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to your folder in either of those programs and make a
```
git clone
```
and the link that appears in the website, where there is a button that says "git clone"

## Get it to work
You will need to have installed **Node**, which you can find in [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/). For the file to work, after you have successfully cloned it and got node, you have to run the following in terminal or Command Prompt:
```
npm install
node app
```
After that, once you have completed the previous steps, go to your **Command Prompt** or **Terminal** and type the following:
```
npm start
```
This will allow the site to run on the **localhost:3000**, so now type that in your browser and you'll be able to interact with the page.
